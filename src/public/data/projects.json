Upward Bound's goal  is to increase the rate at which participants successfully complete high school, and enroll in and graduate from college. Upward Bound stresses the development of academic skills and motivation for students who might not traditionally be considered college-bound. During the academic year, participants are provided a variety of services ranging from individual tutoring, career advising, SAT and MCAS prep, to college-positive workshops, cultural enrichment and much more. In addition, the program addresses other issues critical to success in high school and college such as time management, self-discipline, responsibility, self-esteem, multicultural knowledge, social justice and respect.",
