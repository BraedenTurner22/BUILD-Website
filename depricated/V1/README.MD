# BUILD UMass Website V1

This is the first version of the BUILD UMass Website. It was developed in Summer 2018 by **Nilay Sadavarte** and was used until DD/MM/YY.

The website was made using HTML and vanilla CSS along with [particle.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) for the background animation. The website was pretty basic and used embedded Google Forms for the contact form and applications.
